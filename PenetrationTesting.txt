#Penetration Testing
During my internship, I also worked on some penetration testing. This was such a valuable experience for me because I got to learn the security aspect of the computer world. 

What is penetration testing?
It is testing a computer system or web application to find any vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. 

Advantages of penetration testing:
-Reduces the cost of associated with network down time.
-Meet regulatory requirements and curb fines. 
-Ability to maintain positive image of the company. 
-Asses network efficiency. 

I did some tests using Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) which is is an open-source web application security scanner used to do penetration testing. This application is very easy to use.
